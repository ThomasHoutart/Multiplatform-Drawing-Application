    <string name="tutorial_page_17_title">Artist Chat</string>
    <string name="tutorial_page_17_text">While you are drawing you cannot write chat messages to the other players but you can see what they type and who managed to guess the right word.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_page_18_text">Writing your guess in the highlighted (and only) text field and submitting is enough to guess! Note that you can also send chat messages to your fellow players.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_page_19_title">Back to the Fullscreen Canvas</string>
    <string name="tutorial_page_19_text">If you clicked on the chat icon in the top toolbar while guessing, you will see this view.
